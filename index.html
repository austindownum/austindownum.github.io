<h1> <b>Atlanta Braves Facts and Figures</b> </h1>
<img src="braves.jpg" height="500" width="700">
<p> <h1 style="color:red;"> The Atlanta Braves</h1> are a professional baseball team that is located in Smyrna, Georgia, and play 81 games a year in SunTrust Park.
The Braves are a member of the National East division, along with the Philadelphia Phillies, Miami Marlins, New York Mets, and Washington Nationals.
"Braves Country" includes states from all across the Southeast United States. Including: 
<UL> <h2> <b> Braves Country </b> </h2> <LI> Georgia </LI> <LI> Alabama </LI> <LI> South Carolina </LI> <LI> Tennessee </LI> <LI> Mississippi </LI> <LI> North Carolina </LI> <LI> Kentucky </LI>
all of these states love to #ChopOn, which is the mantra of the Atlanta Braves franchise. </p> 
<p> <em> The Atlanta Braves went 90-72 in the 2018 regular season.</em> The combination of incredible young talent
and extra money to bring in other superstars, <style=font-size: 46px> <u> the Braves are poised for many playoff runs. </u> </style> </p> 
<p> With over $40 million of extra payroll money to spend the next few years, look for the Atlanta Braves to make some major moves in their quest to win a World Series.
If the Braves win a World Series, it would be their second since the franchise moved to Atlanta, and it would also be the city of Atlanta's second championship. </p>
